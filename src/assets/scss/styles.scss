/* 
Use BEM naming convention wherever possible, but don't go overboard!
Don't make several extra BEM objects just to add simple CSS properties,
That's what utilities are for! Keep the CSS as global as possible to minimize bloat.

Separate BEM and utility classes in the markup by using a | separator - CSS won't recognize it!
